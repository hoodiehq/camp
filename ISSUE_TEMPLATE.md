### :octocat:  Your First Pull Request?
We would like to take the opportunity to invite someone who
did not yet contribute to Hoodie to work on this issue. Follow
[@YourFirstPR](https://twitter.com/yourfirstPR) on Twitter for more of
these issues across many open source projects :)

### ü§î What you will need to know
Node.js, Photoshop. Knowledge of [something](link_to_project) would be helpful, but you can
probably figure it out as you go :)

### ‚ùì The Motivation
Bugs are pretty self-explanatory, but some features or changes might
be less obvious. A successful PR is much more satisfying if you
understand how it moves the project forward.

<!-- Remove for feature work, editorial, etc. -->
### üêû The Bug
Steps to reproduce, or a snippet of sample code showing the bad behvior

### :dart: The goal
This should help a new contributor envision success as they get started,
and answer the questions:
- Am I done yet?
- Did I forget anything?
